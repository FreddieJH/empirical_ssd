## From protists to fish?

@giometto2013 used an experimental set up of 13 protist species to show that body size (volume, $\micro m$) for each species could be described by a single parameter value, mean body size. When normalising observed body size to the mean body size of the species, all 13 species showed a similar pattern in their body size distributions (@fig-giometto).

This leads us to the questions:

1.  Does this pattern hold for fish species?
2.  Is the pattern really that interesting? I.e. due to the log-log axis and the scaling, is the variation in the tails of the distribution really where the distributions differ? In other words, does the \$\\sigma\^2\$ parameter of the lognormal distribution really not matter in determining the overall species body size distribution?
3.  Does a lognormal distribution fit well to the observed data?
4.  Can we find another distribution that fits better than the lognormal? or add a parameter to the lognormal distribution to account for the 'deviation' from lognormal?
5.  What is the minimum number of parameters required to fit a distribution to the empirical data that encompasses both the shape and some measure of skewness (maybe a proxy for disturbance).

### Summary of the tabs

1.  Data Cleaning

This tab will go through the the simple data cleaning process, including removing species with too few data points and species and outline the methods used to detect outliers in body size and outliers in geographic location.

2.  Inter-species distribution fitting

This will start with a subset of species and fit a distribution to the spatially and temporally averaged body size data for each species. This will start with just a normal and lognormal distribution

3.  Intra-species distribution fitting

This will look at how distributions change through time and space for a single species.
