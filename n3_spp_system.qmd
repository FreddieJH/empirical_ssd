## Background

We want to chose three fish species from the RLS dataset. These species should ideally be non-target species for fisheries, should cover multiple size classes, and should be relatively abundant.

Fishing pressure data are taken from supplementary table 1 of @audzijonyte2020.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


nontarget_spp <- 
  read_csv("data/audzijonyte_nee_supplementary_table_1_fishing.csv") |> 
  filter(fisheries_target == "rarely") |> 
  pull(species)

head(nontarget_spp)
```
